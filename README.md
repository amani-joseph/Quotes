# Quotes
This is an assignment project to create an application where users can create quotes and have those quotes voted on whether they are terrible or are inspirational. 


## **User Requirements**
The user will have the following features when using the web-app:

1. Create a new quote.
2. Upvote or downvote a quote.(and also see the total number of votes for each quote)
3. Delete a quote
4. See the number of upvotes and number of downvotes for each quote.
 

## Project Objectives
1. This Project is created using the Angular CLI.
2. This project contains a custom model class for the quote
3. This project should have a custom directive to highlight the quote that has the highest upvotes. "# THIS IS PENDING, UNABLE TO SOLVE THE VOTES FILTER LOGIC TO HIGHLIGHT HIGHEST QUOTE"
4. This project contains a form component that has input sections for the quote, the author, and the person who submitted the quote.
5. Each quote begins with an initial upvote and downvote value of 0
6. This project has a component to display the quote and a component to display quote details. For example, the quote details could have the author of the quote and the votes it has.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

This project contains a custom pipe that shows how much time has passed since the quote was created.
